      <h2>Cloud Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        This plugin allows you to determine an instance's physical processor and
        thermal design power based on its instance name.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Coefficient</h2>
      <p>
        Coefficient is a generic plugin for multiplying a value in an input
        array by a given coefficient. You provide the name of the value you want
        to multiply, a coefficient value, and a name to use to append the
        product to the output array. For example, you could multiply cpu/energy
        by 10 and name the result energy-product. energy-product would then be
        added to every observation in your input array as the product of
        cpu/energy and 10.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Divide</h2>
      <p>
        Divide is a generic plugin for doing arithmetic division of two values
        in an input array. You provide the names of the values you want to
        divide, and a name to use to add the divide to the output array. For
        example, boavizta-cpu need cpu/number-cores to work, however
        cloud-metadata returns vcpus-allocated, to get number of cores you
        divide vcpus-allocated by 2.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>E-MEM (energy due to memory)</h2>
      <p>
        e-mem simply multiples the amount of memory being used by a
        energy-per-gb (0.000392 kWh/GB) to yield memory/energy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>E-NET (energy due to networking)</h2>
      <p>
        e-net simply multiplies the amount of data transferred (GB) by a
        coefficient (kWh/GB) to yield network/energy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Grafana Exporter</h2>
      <p>
        Grafana exporter is a modified csv exporter that outputs csv data in a
        format that works well with our Grafana dashboard.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Mock Observations</h2>
      <p>
        A plugin for mocking observations (inputs) for testing and demo purposes
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Multiply</h2>
      <p>
        Multiply is a generic plugin for multiplying two or more values in an
        input array. You provide the names of the values you want to multiply,
        and a name to use to append the product to the output array. For
        example, you could multiply cpu/energy and network/energy and name the
        result energy-product. energy-product would then be added to every
        observation in your input array as the product of cpu/energy and
        network/energy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Regex</h2>
      <p>
        Regex is a generic plugin to match part of one string in an input and
        extract it into an output. You provide the name of the value you want to
        match, and a name to use to add the regex to the output array. For
        example, boavizta-cpu need cpu/name to work, however cloud-metadata
        returns physical-processor which usually contains a long string of
        processors that the instance could be separated by ,, like so: Intel®
        Xeon® Platinum 8272CL,Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1 GHz,Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v4
        2.3 GHz,Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>SCI-E (total energy)</h2>
      <p>
        sci-e is a plugin that simply sums up the contributions to a component's
        energy use. The plugin returns energy which is used as the input to the
        sci-o plugin that calculates operational emissions for the component.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>SCI (software carbon intensity)</h2>
      <p>
        SCI is the final value the framework ultimately aims to return for some
        component or application. It represents the amount of carbon emitted per
        functional unit.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>SCI-M: embodied carbon</h2>
      <p>
        Software systems cause emissions through the hardware that they operate
        on, both through the energy that the physical hardware consumes and the
        emissions associated with manufacturing the hardware. Embodied carbon
        refers to the carbon emitted during the manufacture and eventual
        disposal of a component. It is added to the operational carbon (carbon
        emitted when a component is used) to give an overall SCI score.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>SCI-O (operational emissions)</h2>
      <p>
        Operational emissions refer to the carbon generated by a component while
        it is in use. It is the product of the energy used by the component in
        kWh and the grid intensity in gCO2e/kWh. The operational emissions are
        added to the embodied emissions (calculated using sci-m) to provide an
        overall SCI score for the component.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Shell</h2>
      <p>
        The shell is a wrapper enabling plugins implemented in any other
        programming language to be executed as a part of IF pipeline. For
        example, you might have a standalone plugin written in Python. shell
        spawns a subprocess to execute that Python plugin in a dedicated shell
        and pipes the results back into IF's Typescript process.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>Sum</h2>
      <p>
        Sum is a generic plugin for doing arithmetic sums of two or more values
        in an input array. You provide the names of the values you want to sum,
        and a name to use to add the sum to the output array. For example, you
        could add cpu/energy and network/energy and name the result energy.
        energy would then be added to every observation in your input array as
        the sum of cpu/energy and network/energy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="plugin-container">
      <h2>TDP Finder</h2>
      <p>
        The TDP Finder model finds the thermal design power (TDP) of a given
        processor by looking it up in the model datasets. There are scenarios
        where the lookup can return multiple possible TDP values. In these
        cases, we return the maximum of the possible values. There are also
        cases where no TDP can be found for a specific processor. In these
        cases, we throw an error. The TDP is then used by other plugins to
        calculate the cpu/energy value.
